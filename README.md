There are two main files that are written in order to tidy the data provided and create data objects that can be used for further analysis. Below are the two main files:

- **run_analysis.R**: This is the main file of the program
- **UtilityFunctions.R**: This is a supporting file with resuable methods

The data from the link is downloaded into the **data/** folder of the project and unzipped in the same
folder. The folder structure inside the zip file is still retained.
